# Voice Assistant for Home Automation

This project implements a **fully local, wake‑word‑activated voice assistant** built in Python. It uses **Faster Whisper** for real‑time speech recognition and **RapidFuzz** for high‑accuracy fuzzy matching between transcribed commands and a list of command variants defined in a CSV file. The transcribed command is sent to a **Raspberry Pi 5** connected to the same network as the laptop, and it executes various actions by controlling the GPIO pins.

This is an **uncompleted** version.  
The completed version should add: 
* migrating all processing inside the Raspberry, eliminating the need for an external laptop
* dividing tasks for real-time execution

# Audio Processing Pipeline

The audio system is built around:

* `sounddevice.InputStream()` for real-time audio capture
* A **worker thread** that processes audio chunks
* A **rolling buffer** used for wake‑word scanning
* A dedicated **command buffer** used to accumulate speech after activation

### Key Parameters

| Variable                    | Meaning                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `SAMPLE_RATE=16000`         | Model‑friendly sample rate                  |
| `CHUNK_DURATION=0.5s`       | Audio chunk size                            |
| `PAUSE_THRESHOLD=1.0s`      | Silence that ends command                   |
| `MIN_COMMAND_DURATION=1.0s` | Minimum speech duration required            |
| `WAKE_WORD="garmin"`        | Activation phrase                           |
| `WAKE_WORD_DELAY=1.2s`      | Delay after wake word until command capture |

# 💤 Wake-Word Detection

Wake‑word detection is performed by running Faster Whisper on a rolling 1.5–3 second buffer.

### Steps:

1. Rolling audio buffer updated by `audio_callback`
2. Worker thread calls `detect_wake_word()` asynchronously
3. Segments are transcribed with VAD enabled
4. If wake word is found:

   * Assistant enters **recording mode**
   * Beep sound played
   * Command buffer initialized
   * Debounce applied to avoid double triggers

### Snippet

```python
def detect_wake_word(audio):
    segments, _ = model.transcribe(audio, vad_filter=True)
    text = " ".join(seg.text for seg in segments).lower()
    if WAKE_WORD in text:
        wake_detected = True
```

---

# Command Recognition

Once recording is active:

* All speech is accumulated in `command_buffer`
* Silence is measured using `is_speech()`
* When silence exceeds `PAUSE_THRESHOLD`, the assistant transcribes the full buffer

### Transcription

```python
segments, _ = model.transcribe(audio, beam_size=3, vad_filter=True)
text = " ".join(seg.text for seg in segments).lower()
```

Wake‑word is removed from the command if present:

```python
text = text.replace(WAKE_WORD, "").strip()
```

# Command Matching (RapidFuzz)

Commands are defined in `commands.csv` with the following schema:

```
command_key,variants,action
```

Example:

```
turn_on_led,turn on led|activate led|...,LED ON
```

### Loading Commands

```python
var2act, variants = load_commands("commands.csv")
```

* `var2act` maps each phrase variant → action
* `variants` is a flat list used by RapidFuzz

### Matching

```python
result = process.extractOne(text, variants, score_cutoff=cutoff)
```

* The best matching variant above `cutoff` (default 70%) is selected

# Running the Project

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install sounddevice numpy faster-whisper rapidfuzz torch paho-mqtt
```

Run assistant:

```bash
python main.py
```
On the Raspberry Pi, the Mosquitto broker needs to be activated:

```
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

Run subscriber on the Raspberry:

```
python mqtt_subscriber.py
```
Now start sending commands to the vocal assistant!

# Security

This example uses an unauthenticated broker (local network). For production, secure Mosquitto with TLS and authentication.
